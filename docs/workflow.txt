Modify these parts of the python script with your info:

# Replace with your API key and secret
api_key = 'API KEY'
api_secret = 'API SECRET'

# Get photos from the album
user_id = 'USER ID'  # Replace with your Flickr user ID



Script runs like this:
If the album ID is 1234567890 and you want to save the photo details in a file called album_details.csv, you would run:

python flickr_album_download.py 1234567890 album_details.csv
